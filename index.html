      There is a broad set of human beliefs, attitudes and behaviours around the
      issue of magical animals, referring to both mythical animals not
      recognized by science and extant animals that are recognized by science
      but have magical properties. This is a broad issue ranging from spiritual
      beliefs around mythical animals living in Malagasy forests, to cultural
      heritage associated with the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland. Beliefs and
      behaviours around magical animals can have positive and negative impacts
      on biodiversity conservation goals. Here we explore how magical animals
      can influence conservation goals, how conservation biology and practice
      has thought about magical animals, and some of the limitations of current
      approaches, particularly the failure to consider magical animals as part
      of wider systems of belief and culture.
