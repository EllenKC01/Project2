        <p>How do indigenous communities hunt without pushing target species to local extinction? In other words, how have communities retained sustainable practices over countless generations? One answer is given in a new study by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and the Center for International Research in Agronomy and Development (CIRAD): supernatural beliefs. Looking at a community of indigenous people on the Indonesian island of Seram, researchers found that supernatural beliefs ensured animals never vanished for good.</p>
        <p>“The fact is that for many communities, supernatural agencies are realities,” explains Masatoshi Sasaoka, a post doctoral fellow with CIFOR, in a press release.</p>
        <p>The people of Seram’s diet is largely made up of sago, but for protein they hunt mostly northern common cuscus (Phalanger orientalis), but also timor deer (Cervus timorensis), Celebes warty pig (Sus celebensis), and a number of bird species. In order to keep track of hunting rights, the village of around three hundred people has divided their forest into over 250 lots. When a lot is hunted out they impose seli kaitahu or a moratorium on hunting in the lot to allow wildlife populations to bounce back. The moratorium is enforced not by park rangers or police officers, but by forest spirits. Any person who hunts in a lot under seli kaitahu faces punishment from supernatural forces. The fear of breaking seli kaitahu is upheld by stories of people who have ignored the moratorium and ended up paying for it, sometimes with their lives. The researchers retell a particularly graphic story wherein a hunter is killed by a falling tree for having broken seli kaitahu. This also ensures concord in the community, since punishment is not exacted by other community members, but by forces beyond them.</p>
        <p>Notably at the time of their study 203 lots, or over 70 percent, were protected under seli kaitahu. Only forty lots were open to hunting.</p>
        <p>There have been numerous other studies showing that supernatural beliefs of indigenous communities often rein-in resource use. Research in Guyana has found that hunters avoid potent spiritual sites, creating refuges for animals. In the Cote d’Ivoire some communities refrain from hunting or fishing on Wednesdays, which has become a day for the “spirits and other inhabitants” of the forest,” according to the authors of research published in mongabay.com’s Tropical Conservation Science.</p>
        <p>“Despite the evidence of their importance,” says Sasaoka, “supernatural beliefs of indigenous peoples continue to be regarded as ‘unscientific’ and ignored by agencies like NGOs and governments who seek to develop ‘self-directed’ indigenous resource management strategies with communities.”</p>
        <p class = "final-p">The researchers recommend a new model for resource management that works with such beliefs, not against them. Eroding such beliefs often comes at the price of local wildlife and the people who depend on them.</p>

            <p>Who are indigenous peoples?</p>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>There is no one single definition of indigenous peoples at the international level that can be applicable to all indigenous communities due to the rich diversity of this group between regions and countries. However, some criteria have been defined, the most important being self-identification. On an individual basis, an indigenous person is one who belongs to these indigenous populations through self-identification as indigenous (group consciousness) and is recognized and accepted by these populations as one of its members (acceptance by the group).”</p>

            <p>Where does mythology come from?</p>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Only our species, Homo sapiens, is known to invent fictional tales and convey them through representational imagery. Archaeologists have eagerly sought the origins of our distinctive artistic behavior. For a long time the oldest examples of figurative art (as opposed to abstract mark making) and depictions of fictitious creatures all came from sites in Europe dated to less than 40,000 years ago. But in recent years researchers have uncovered older instances of figurative art in Southeast Asia.</p>

            <p>What was the first instance of mythology in Indonesia?</p>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>In a paper published in December 2019 in Nature, Maxime Aubert, Adhi Agus Oktaviana and Adam Brumm, all at Griffith University in Australia, and their colleagues report that art found on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia—a cave painting—appears to show several fantastical human figures hunting real-life animals. If they are right, the find could also constitute the oldest pictorial record of storytelling and supernatural thinking in the world. The hunters in the paintings appear humanlike but exhibit mysterious animal traits—one possesses a tail, for instance, and another has a beak. Such human-animal hybrids are called therianthropes (derived from the Greek words for “beast” and “human”), and they are considered to be indicators of spiritual thinking.</p>

            <p>Why does it matter if species or ecosystems are lost/become extinct?</p>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Scientific evidence tells us that life has existed on Planet Earth for around 3.8 billion years. Every species living today, including humans, lives in a complex web of interrelationships with other species, reliant upon them for food, clean air, clean water and shelter. As more and more species become extinct, the fabric of this web weakens and threatens all of life on Earth.</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t it be complex and costly to involve tribal peoples properly and fairly in conservation projects on their lands?</p>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of organizations which claim to work for the environment. Every 24 hours, Conservation International receives $290,000, the IUCN pulls in over $320,000, WWF $2 million, and The Nature Conservancy $2.6 million: there is hardly a shortage of resources. Were such funds to be deployed appropriately, in real and equal partnerships with tribal peoples, the latter are likely to prove far more efficient and better custodians of their own lands than anyone else. The evidence shows that the most economical way, by far, to protect environments is to ensure tribal peoples control their own lands, the territories they have infinitely more expertise about than anyone else.</p>
