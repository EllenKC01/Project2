        Dr. George Holmes noticed the connection in his fieldwork from all over
        the world. “Magical beliefs” (a broad category that ranges from beliefs
        in mythical animals to connections with animals’ fabled properties, to
        spiritualism and traditions) all have an impact on the welfare of
        real-life animals and ecosystems. Holmes and University of Leeds Ph.D.
        student, Caroline Ward, recently published a proposal in the journal
        Oryx that conservation biologists carefully consider beliefs in magical
        animals, as well as superstitions about animals’ magical properties,
        before making conservation policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        “[Conservationists] often talk about the role of economic incentives in
        shaping behavior, as in, can we pay [locals] to not kill a species? But
        there are all sorts of other ways that people react to, and behave
        around endangered species. This issue of people’s beliefs in magic is
        actually really important,” says Holmes in the proposal, who has been
        researching interactions between conservation efforts and human society
        for several years.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, as the proposal notes, some magical beliefs can lead to
        protections for certain animals. In Kombolcha, Ethiopia, hyenas are
        believed to eat evil spirits and pass on supernatural messages through
        their howls. Hyenas also keep crop-eating herbivores in check. Because
        of the positive association with hyenas, they are supported in
        Kombolcha.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then there is the flip side. For example, in the north part of
        Madagascar, the appearance of an endangered aye-aye lemur is seen as a
        premonition of death or sickness. In many villages, it is believed that
        the only way to prevent bad luck is to kill the aye-aye. A similar view
        is seen in Haiti, Jamacia, and the Dominican Republic with owls, which
        are seen as connected to witches.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what to do when cultural beliefs clash with conservation efforts? “I
        think it’s somewhat frustrating because we can’t really give one
        approach fix to every situation,” Ward told Atlas Obscura. But one thing
        is clear on how to handle this issue: awareness. “It’s more a matter of
        being more aware that these beliefs exist, and that just because they
        don’t follow the scientific belief system doesn’t mean we can push them
        to one side,” Ward elaborated.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s also important to note that European and Western people are not
        exempt from these beliefs either, Holmes and Ward note. For instance,
        the Loch Ness Monster brings thousands of eco-tourists to the famed
        Scottish Lake every year and then there is the Icelandic respect for
        Huldufólk (meaning elves), which halted the construction of a highway
        through their traditional lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s genuinely around the world,” says Holmes. “And these things
        matter. People’s beliefs genuinely have a material impact on the
        well-being of endangered habitats, and ecosystems, and species,” Ward
        told Altas Obscura.

          Myths can have serious ramifications for animals when animal parts are
          believed to be beneficial to humans. For instance, the practice of
          consuming bear bile is extremely popular across Asia. It is believed
          that the bear’s bile fluid contains medicinal properties that can do
          everything from cure a hangover to improve dental hygiene and treat
          about every other ailment in between (when sometimes taking an Advil
          will do the job).
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      <p>
        Sun bears and Moon bears are the primary targets of the bile industry.
        Typically, these bears are captured from the wild at a young age and
        sold into life on a bile farm. Bear bile farms are unbelievably cruel
        operations where bears are locked into tiny “crush” cages and tortured
        with sharp objects to drain the bile from inside their gallbladders,
        over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bears aren’t the only victims of traditional beliefs. Critically
        endangered pangolins are highly traded for their scales and meat for
        traditional medicine and remedies. Tiger bone is believed to have
        various medicinal qualities. It can also be infused in wine which is
        considered a particular delicacy; many tiger farms now have wineries
        right on their property. Additionally, manta rays are caught, killed,
        and their scales sold as medicinal products. Sadly, the sale and trade
        of exotic animals and their parts garner an enormous amount of profit
        annually. In the past 40 years alone, around 52 percent of the world’s
        wildlife has disappeared.
